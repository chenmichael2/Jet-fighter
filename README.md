### Spaceship Racer

## Overview
Spaceship Racer is my first ever creation using code. It is a two player game where two spaceships have to reach the other side to save Earth. But, there are asteroids in the way and it takes 5 different timelines to realize the true reality to save Earth. 

## How to Play
After choosing the difficulty levels, Press `play`. Player one uses the keys `w` and `s` to move up and down respectively and Player two uses the keys `i` and `k` to move up and down respectively as well. A player is reset everytime an asteroid hits the player and first player to 5 wins. If you want to choose a different difficulty level, press the `restart` button. If you want to keep playing press `play` again.
